# Grade-Manager
This is a Microsoft Excel file (.xlsm) that can be used to keep track of grades of students in a class. Students can be divided into sections with different teachers assistants(TA). TAs each get a XLSX file to update their students' grades. All the grades and new assignments can be synced and updated from the main Grade Manager file.
