# Grade-Manager
This is a Microsoft Excel file (.xlsm) that can be used to keep track of grades of students in a class. Students can be divided into sections with different teachers assistants(TA). TAs each get a XLSX file to update their students' grades. All the grades and new assignments can be synced and updated from the main Grade Manager file.  
Read the article about this project on my blog for more information - [Click Here](https://peshalaprabhapoorna.wordpress.com/2023/07/23/grade-manager-for-tracking-student-performance-ms-excel/)

*Grade Manager.xlsm* - Run this file to initiate the class, section and assignment creation. This file will create a folder for the class, save the Grade Manager file in that folder and create a sections folder to store the files with students seperated into respetive sections.  

*Roster.xlsx* - Example roster file with students names, student ID numbers, section numbers. Use this to test the Grade Manager.  

*Fill Grades.xlsm* - Use this file to assign random grades to all students and assignments in files of the sections folder before testing the **Sync** feature in the Grade Manager file.  

*MAT101* - This is an example folder that was create using the Grade Manger. The structure of folders and files should come out the way it is in this folder. Do not try to run the Grade Mananger - MAT101.xlsm file it will not run some features properly as it was not created on your computer.  

Other files - Other files are guide files with example code for all the features that are integrated into the Grade Manager file. If anyone wishes to replicate this project they can use the example files as a guide.
